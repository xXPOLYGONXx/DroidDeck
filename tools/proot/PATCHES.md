# proot patches carried by the app

Built by `tools/proot/build.sh` with the NDK on top of termux/proot `4dba3afb` (Termux's
5.1.107-70 package, the proot the Linux runtime ships at `opt/android-host/proot`; every
`file.c:line` site in that binary matches this commit). talloc is linked in statically from
Samba's release tarball, so the apk carries one self-contained `libproot.so` plus
`libproot-loader.so`, and `LinuxRuntime` prefers them over the runtime's copy.

Ported from WinNative (`feature/proot-enhancements`, e7af0f24):

- `0001-tracee-lookup-by-pid.patch` - tracees are hashed by pid, so each ptrace stop finds its
  tracee without walking one list entry per thread, and terminated tracees are swept only after a
  termination.
- `0002-canon-resolve-parent-at-once.patch` - a clean absolute guest path at least three
  directories deep under the rootfs binding alone has its parent opened once with `O_PATH` and
  taken as canonical when `/proc/self/fd` names the path proot would build, replacing an `lstat`
  per component. The final component of a call that does not follow it is no longer `lstat`ed.
  Extensions still see the parent's host path, and the fast path stays off while the f2fs
  workaround is active.
- `0003-clone3-flags-read-guard.patch` - a thread created with `clone3` keeps the flags it
  inherited when `struct clone_args` cannot be read, instead of being tracked as a fork.

Ported from WinNative (`main`, 53836ca9, "Fix/performance and vac"):

- `0004-seccomp-filter-by-argument.patch` - the seccomp filter traces `prctl` only for
  `PR_SET_DUMPABLE`, `setrlimit` only for `RLIMIT_STACK` and `prlimit64` only when it sets a new
  `RLIMIT_STACK`, the only cases proot acts on; every other call runs without a stop. `uname` is
  traced by the core only on x86_64, the one arch it rewrites; kompat still adds it for
  `--kernel-release`.
- `0005-seccomp-skip-unneeded-sysexit.patch` - a seccomp stop fetches the registers once and
  looks the filter flags up by syscall number, instead of a `PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG` and a second
  register fetch. The flags table is built from proot's list merged with the enabled extensions'
  (kompat and fake_id0 here), so it is exactly what the filter reports. `wait4`/`waitpid` left to
  the kernel and `accept`/`accept4` without a sockaddr skip their exit stop, unless an extension
  replaced the syscall (kompat turning `accept4` into `accept`).
- `0006-clone3-exit-signal.patch` - `clone3` flags and exit signal are read as the 64-bit fields
  of `struct clone_args`, so a `clone3` fork is told apart from a thread when proot decides how the
  child is traced.
- `0007-proc-self-thread-group.patch` - tracees track their thread group, `/proc/self` names it
  instead of the calling thread, and `/proc/thread-self` resolves to `/proc/<tgid>/task/<tid>`.
- `0008-fchmodat2-openat2.patch` - `fchmodat2` paths are translated (honouring
  `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`), `openat2` answers `ENOSYS` so callers fall back to the translated
  `openat`, and syscall numbers past the end of a table are rejected instead of read.
- `0009-tracee-relatives-sweep.patch` - tracees count their children, so a terminating thread
  with no children or ptracees no longer walks every tracee; the per-stop memory collector is
  emptied instead of freed and reallocated.

Added for Flatpak:

- `0010-new-mount-api-enosys.patch` - `open_tree`, `move_mount`, `fspick` and `mount_setattr`
  answer `ENOSYS`. They take paths proot never translated, so libglnx's `open_tree(AT_FDCWD, "/")`
  handed Flatpak a descriptor for the host's root and it tried to create directories there
  (`mkdirat(root): Operation not permitted`); unsupported, libglnx falls back to `openat`.
- `0012-android-hardlink-denial.patch` - Android's SELinux policy denies apps hard links, so
  `linkat` fails with `EACCES` and Flatpak could not create its repo (`Creating repo: linkat:
  Permission denied`). `O_TMPFILE` answers `EOPNOTSUPP`, so libglnx writes a named temporary file
  and renames it, and a denied link answers `EPERM`, on which ostree's checkout copies instead.
Added by DroidDeck:

- `0011-kompat-utsname-only.patch` - `--kernel-release` (the guest's `DroidDeck` hostname) loads
  kompat, whose filter traps `futex`, `fcntl`, `epoll_pwait`, `pselect6`, `pipe2`, `eventfd2`,
  `socket` and more, and which strips `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` on every `execve`, so glibc runs without
  the vDSO. When the virtual release is not older than the real kernel and the hwcap is left
  alone, every one of those handlers is a no-op: kompat now traces only `uname`, `sethostname`
  and `setdomainname` and leaves the auxv as the kernel wrote it. On an SD 8 Gen 2 guest this
  took a futex ping-pong from 467 to 97 us, `epoll_pwait` from 60 to 0.8 us and `fcntl` from
  40-107 to 0.4 us, and `clock_gettime` back to the vDSO.
- `0012-fake_id0-identity-only.patch` - `-i uid:gid` (for Xwayland's setgid/setuid before it runs
  xkbcomp) loads fake_id0, whose filter traps every `fstat`/`newfstatat`/`stat` (entry and exit),
  every `sendmsg` (all Wayland, X11, Chromium and PulseAudio traffic), `socket`, `getsockopt`, the
  `get*id` family and the chown/chmod family. When the ids given are the ones proot really has and
  are not 0, every one of those handlers is a no-op; fake_id0 now traces only the `set*id` family
  and the xattr permission fixups, and leaves set-user-ID bits alone on `execve` (Android mounts the
  app's data `nosuid`, so the kernel would not honour them either), which keeps the ids fixed. On an
  x86_64 host build under the same options: `fstat` 41.7 -> 1.3 us, `sendmsg` 18.0 -> 2.5 us.
- `0013-seccomp-ioctl-by-request-and-kernel-exit-stops.patch` - every `ioctl` stopped on entry and
  exit, which is every GPU submit and wait. The filter now traces only the requests enter.c and
  exit.c act on (`TCSETSF`, the four termios2 requests, `FICLONE`) and allows the rest at once, and
  the ioctl block is emitted first (after WinNative 53836ca9, which traces only the termios2 ones).
  The `faccessat2` exit stop (termux 5ba8b95, for glibc's ENOSYS fallback on kernels before 5.8) and
  the `statx` one (emulation on kernels before 4.11) are dropped when the running kernel is newer.
  Host build: `ioctl` 31.6 -> 0.5 us; `stat`/`statx`/`faccessat2` about 44 -> 28 us (one stop).

Prototype (inert unless `PROOT_FASTPATH` is set; see `docs/development/proot-performance.md`):

- `0014-fastpath-trampoline.patch` - with `PROOT_FASTPATH`, every `SECCOMP_RET_TRACE` in the filter
  is preceded by a check of the caller's address, and a syscall made from the fast path's trampoline
  page (`fastpath/fastpath.c`, `0xffff00000`) runs without a stop: the tracee already translated it.
  The check comes after the syscall-number dispatch, so untraced syscalls stay constant-ALLOW and keep
  the kernel's seccomp action cache (checking first cost every syscall the full filter: +0.5 ms an
  exec). `chdir`/`fchdir`, still emulated, also move the kernel's cwd to the host directory, and the
  first tracee starts at `-w`'s, so relative lookups inside the tracee resolve where proot would.
  SM8850 (adb shell): `stat` 25.3 -> 0.6 us, `open+close` 25.3 -> 0.9 us, ENOENT 22.9 -> 1.6 us,
  8 threads `stat`ing 89k -> 3.6M/s; equivalence suite (`bench/equiv.py`) byte-identical to proot.
- `0015-lost-fork-events.patch` - works around a problem reported on Xiaomi's msm 4.14
  kernel: the kernel sometimes tells PRoot that a new process or thread was created,
  but gives its ID as zero. Without the ID, PRoot cannot finish setting it up, which
  can leave the session stuck during startup. The patch looks for the new process or
  thread in `/proc`, where Linux exposes information about running tasks. It continues
  only if exactly one matches, then uses PRoot's existing setup code. When the kernel
  supplies a valid ID, this search is skipped. The patch does not add background polling.
  It cannot recover a creation notification that never arrives or a child it cannot
  identify uniquely.
